### ✨ Hi, I'm Sharmin!

#### 💬 3rd year Mechatronic Engineering/Computer Science student | Software Engineering Intern

📝 I primarily work with ReactJS as my job revolves around front-end development, but in my own time I've been working on projects that are mainly in Python. 

🙇‍♀️ My interests lie within cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, and hope to dive deeper within both disciplines as I continue studying both within and outside of my degree.

🎯 I enjoy playing around with a good API, web scraping, and designing UIs.

This GitHub is certainly a WIP, but I'm excited to release more projects in due time.

~~(I'm still learning about most if not all of the things I'm working with)~~
